# Toast Connector Example

## Connector overview

This is a custom [Fivetran connector](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk) implementation to extract and sync data from the [Toast POS API](https://doc.toasttab.com/) into a destination warehouse. Toast is a restaurant management platform providing point-of-sale, labor, menu, and operational data.

For full implementation details, see the [Toast connector example code](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran-csdk-connectors/tree/main/toast/).

## Requirements

- Toast API credentials: `clientId`, `clientSecret`, `userAccessType`
- Domain to connect to (e.g., `api.toasttab.com`)
- A Fernet key (`key`) for encrypting access tokens
- `initialSyncStart` ISO timestamp to define the start of sync window
- [Supported Python versions](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran-csdk-connectors/blob/main/README.md#requirements)

## Getting started

Refer to the [Connector SDK Setup Guide](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/setup-guide) to get started.

To initialize a new Connector SDK project using this connector as a starting point, run:

```
fivetran init --template toast
```

`fivetran init` initializes a new Connector SDK project by setting up the project structure, configuration files, and a connector you can run immediately with `fivetran debug`. For more information on `fivetran init`, refer to the [Connector SDK `init` documentation](https://fivetran.com/docs/connector-sdk/connector-development-and-configuration/connector-sdk-commands#fivetraninit).

> Note: Ensure you have updated the `configuration.json` file with the necessary parameters before running `fivetran debug`. See the [Configuration file](#configuration-file) section for details on the required configuration parameters.

## Features

- Syncs data from multiple Toast endpoints, including orders, employees, shifts, menus, and more
- Automatically handles nested JSON structures and normalizes them into relational tables
- Includes incremental sync via time-based windowing and state checkpointing
- Graceful handling of rate limits, authentication, and API errors
- Supports voids, deletions, and nested child entities
- Uses Fernet encryption for token security in state

## Configuration file

Example `configuration.json`:

```json
{
  "clientId": "your_client_id",
  "clientSecret": "your_client_secret",
  "userAccessType": "TOAST_MACHINE_CLIENT",
  "domain": "ws-api.toasttab.com",
  "initialSyncStart": "2023-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
  "key": "your_base64_encoded_fernet_key"
}
```

> Note: When submitting connector code as a [Community Connector](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran-csdk-connectors/tree/main) in the open-source [Connector SDK repository](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran-csdk-connectors/tree/main), ensure the `configuration.json` file has placeholder values. When adding the connector to your production repository, ensure that the `configuration.json` file is not checked into version control to protect sensitive information.

## Requirements file

> Note: The `fivetran_connector_sdk:latest`, `requests:2.33.0`, `grpcio:1.78.0`, and `grpcio-tools:1.78.0` packages are pre-installed in the Fivetran environment. To avoid dependency conflicts, do not declare them in your `requirements.txt`.

## Data handling

The connector performs the following actions for each key aspect:
- Authentication: Generates and caches a Toast token using the provided credentials
- Sync loop: Runs in 30-day time chunks, paginating through endpoints
- Data normalization: Flattens nested objects and lists using `flatten_dict`, `extract_fields`, and `stringify_lists`
- Upserts and deletes: Emits operations using `op.upsert()` and `op.delete()`
- Checkpointing: Updates state after each window to resume seamlessly

## Error handling

- Retries on 401 Unauthorized (max 3)
- Skips 403 Forbidden
- Backs off on 429 Too Many Requests
- Skips on 400 and 409 errors with logging

Uses Fivetran SDK logging levels (`info`, `fine`, `warning`, `severe`) for detailed sync visibility.

## Tables created

The entity-relationship diagram (ERD) below shows how tables are linked in the Toast schema.

### Core tables

- `restaurant`
- `job`, `employee`, `shift`, `break`, `time_entry`
- `orders`, `orders_check`, `payment`

### Configuration tables

- `menu`, `menu_item`, `menu_group`, `discounts`, `tables`, etc.

### Nested children

- `orders_check_payment`, `orders_check_selection`, `orders_check_selection_modifier`, etc.

### Cash management

- `cash_entry`, `cash_deposit`
