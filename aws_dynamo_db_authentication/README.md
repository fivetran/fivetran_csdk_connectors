# AWS DynamoDB Connector Using IAM Role Authentication

## Connector overview

This connector demonstrates how to sync data from Amazon DynamoDB using the Fivetran Connector SDK and AWS IAM role-based authentication. It authenticates using assumed IAM roles via STS, discovers all tables, extracts their primary keys dynamically, and syncs each table using a parallel scan.

This example highlights:
- Authenticating with AWS via role assumption.
- Dynamically generating schema from DynamoDB metadata.
- Efficient record fetching with `aws_dynamodb_parallel_scan`.
- Safely syncing multiple tables in a single connector.

Refer to [Boto3 DynamoDB Docs](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/dynamodb.html) for more detail on AWS client behavior.

## Requirements

- [Supported Python versions](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_csdk_connectors/blob/main/README.md#requirements)
- Operating system:
  - Windows: 10 or later (64-bit only)
  - macOS: 13 (Ventura) or later (Apple Silicon [arm64] or Intel [x86_64])
  - Linux: Distributions such as Ubuntu 20.04 or later, Debian 10 or later, or Amazon Linux 2 or later (arm64 or x86_64)

## Getting started

Refer to the [Connector SDK Setup Guide](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/setup-guide) to get started.

To initialize a new Connector SDK project using this connector as a starting point, run:

```
fivetran init --template aws_dynamo_db_authentication
```

`fivetran init` initializes a new Connector SDK project by setting up the project structure, configuration files, and a connector you can run immediately with `fivetran debug`. For more information on `fivetran init`, refer to the [Connector SDK `init` documentation](https://fivetran.com/docs/connector-sdk/connector-development-and-configuration/connector-sdk-commands#fivetraninit).

> Note: Ensure you have updated the `configuration.json` file with the necessary parameters before running `fivetran debug`. See the [Configuration file](#configuration-file) section for details on the required configuration parameters.

## Features

- Uses `boto3` STS to assume a role for DynamoDB access.
- Discovers all available tables using `list_tables()`.
- Dynamically builds schema by querying each table's key schema.
- Uses `aws_dynamodb_parallel_scan` to perform fast, concurrent scans.
- Syncs paginated records via `op.upsert()`.
- Checkpoints sync state using `op.checkpoint()`.

## Configuration file

The connector requires the following configuration parameters:

```json
{
  "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID": "<YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID>",
  "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY": "<YOUR_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>",
  "ROLE_ARN": "<YOUR_ROLE_ARN>",
  "REGION": "<YOUR_REGION>"
}
```

> Note: When submitting connector code as a [Community Connector](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_csdk_connectors/tree/main) in the open-source [Connector SDK repository](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_csdk_connectors/tree/main), ensure the `configuration.json` file has placeholder values. When adding the connector to your production repository, ensure that the `configuration.json` file is not checked into version control to protect sensitive information.

## Requirements file

This connector requires the following Python packages:

```
aws_dynamodb_parallel_scan==1.1.0
boto3==1.37.4
```

> Note: [Some packages](https://fivetran.com/docs/connector-sdk/technical-reference#preinstalledpackages) are pre-installed in the Connector SDK runtime environment. To avoid dependency conflicts, do not declare them in your `requirements.txt`.

## Authentication

This connector authenticates using AWS IAM role assumption via STS. To set up the required credentials:

1. In the AWS Console, create an IAM user with programmatic access and save the generated `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`.
2. Create an IAM role (or choose an existing one) and attach the `AmazonDynamoDBFullAccess` policy to it.
3. Edit the role's trust policy to allow the IAM user to assume it.
4. Copy the role ARN (format: `arn:aws:iam::<account-id>:role/<role-name>`).
5. Set `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `ROLE_ARN`, and `REGION` in `configuration.json`.

## Pagination

Pagination is handled via:
- `aws_dynamodb_parallel_scan.get_paginator()`
- Parallel scanning with `TotalSegments=4` and `Limit=10` per page.

## Data handling

- Schema is inferred by calling `describe_table()` on each table.
- Keys and values from each DynamoDB record are normalized using `map_item()`.
- Nested arrays are converted to strings.
- All tables are synced in parallel and checkpointed.

## Error handling

- Errors during schema discovery or sync are logged with `log.severe()`.
- Exceptions are re-raised to surface failures in the connector.
- You can extend error handling with retry/backoff for robustness.

## Tables created

The connector creates a `CUSTOMERS` table:

```json
{
  "table": "customers",
  "primary_key": ["customer_id"],
  "columns": "inferred"
}
```
