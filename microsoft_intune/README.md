# Microsoft Intune Connector Example

## Connector overview

This example demonstrates how to build a connector for [Microsoft Intune](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/microsoft-intune) with Fivetran Connector SDK, using the [Microsoft Graph API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/use-the-api) to retrieve managed device data. The connector pulls data from the Intune managed devices endpoint and delivers it to your Fivetran destination in a single table called `MANAGED_DEVICES`.

## Requirements

- Microsoft Intune credentials: `tenant_id`, `client_id`, and `client_secret`
- [Supported Python versions](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran-csdk-connectors/blob/main/README.md#requirements)
- Operating system:
  - Windows: 10 or later (64-bit only)
  - macOS: 13 (Ventura) or later (Apple Silicon [arm64] or Intel [x86_64])
  - Linux: Distributions such as Ubuntu 20.04 or later, Debian 10 or later, or Amazon Linux 2 or later (arm64 or x86_64)

## Getting started

Refer to the [Connector SDK setup guide](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/setup-guide) to get started.

To initialize a new Connector SDK project using this connector as a starting point, run:

```
fivetran init --template microsoft_intune
```

`fivetran init` initializes a new Connector SDK project by setting up the project structure, configuration files, and a connector you can run immediately with `fivetran debug`. For more information on `fivetran init`, refer to the [Connector SDK `init` documentation](https://fivetran.com/docs/connector-sdk/connector-development-and-configuration/connector-sdk-commands#fivetraninit).

> Note: Ensure you have updated the `configuration.json` file with the necessary parameters before running `fivetran debug`. See the [Configuration file](#configuration-file) section for details on the required configuration parameters.

## Features

- Retrieves managed device data from Microsoft Intune using the Microsoft Graph API (see `update` function)
- Handles API pagination using the `@odata.nextLink` field (see `update` function)
- Converts list values in device records to JSON strings for compatibility (see `list_to_json` function)
- Delivers data to a single table, `MANAGED_DEVICES`
- Uses Fivetran Connector SDK logging for status and error reporting (see `log` usage)

## Configuration file

The connector expects a `configuration.json` file with the following structure:

```json
{
  "tenant_id": "<YOUR_TENANT_ID>",
  "client_id": "<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>",
  "client_secret": "<YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET>"
}
```

> Note: When submitting connector code as a [Community Connector](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran-csdk-connectors/tree/main) in the open-source [Connector SDK repository](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran-csdk-connectors/tree/main), ensure the `configuration.json` file has placeholder values. When adding the connector to your production repository, ensure that the `configuration.json` file is not checked into version control to protect sensitive information.

## Authentication

The connector uses a OAuth2 client credentials flow to authenticate with Microsoft Graph API. You will need to provide your Azure tenant ID, client ID, and client secret in the `configuration.json` file. The connector retrieves an access token using these credentials (see `get_access_token` function in `test.py`).

## Pagination

The connector handles pagination using the `@odata.nextLink` field returned by the Microsoft Graph API. It continues to request additional pages until all managed devices are retrieved (see `update` function, lines ~38-81).

## Data handling

- Data is retrieved from the Microsoft Graph API using the `update` function (see lines ~38-81)
- List values in device records are converted to JSON strings using the `list_to_json` function (see lines ~84-89)
- Data is delivered to Fivetran using the `op.upsert` operation
- The schema is defined in the `schema` function (see lines ~13-18)

## Error handling

- Uses Fivetran Connector SDK logging for info and severe error messages (see `log` usage throughout)
- Raises exceptions for failed authentication or API errors (see `get_access_token` and `update` functions)

## Tables created

- `managed_devices` – Contains all managed device records retrieved from Microsoft Intune.

Sample data structure:

| id                                   | deviceName | operatingSystem | ... |
|--------------------------------------|------------|----------------|-----|
| 12345678-90ab-cdef-1234-567890abcdef | SurfacePro | Windows        | ... |
