# Solace Connector Example

## Connector overview

This connector demonstrates how to sync data from a Solace queue using the [Fivetran Connector SDK](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk). It fetches messages from a durable Solace queue using the Solace Messaging API, processes the events, and upserts them into a destination table. The connector supports incremental syncs using message timestamps and checkpointing to ensure continuity.

## Requirements

- [Supported Python versions](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran-csdk-connectors/blob/main/README.md#requirements)
- Operating system:
  - Windows: 10 or later (64-bit only)
  - macOS: 13 (Ventura) or later (Apple Silicon [arm64] or Intel [x86_64])
  - Linux: Distributions such as Ubuntu 20.04 or later, Debian 10 or later, or Amazon Linux 2 or later (arm64 or x86_64)

## Getting started

Refer to the [Connector SDK Setup Guide](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/setup-guide) to get started.

To initialize a new Connector SDK project using this connector as a starting point, run:

```
fivetran init --template solace
```

`fivetran init` initializes a new Connector SDK project by setting up the project structure, configuration files, and a connector you can run immediately with `fivetran debug`. For more information on `fivetran init`, refer to the [Connector SDK `init` documentation](https://fivetran.com/docs/connector-sdk/connector-development-and-configuration/connector-sdk-commands#fivetraninit).

> Note: Ensure you have updated the `configuration.json` file with the necessary parameters before running `fivetran debug`. See the [Configuration file](#configuration-file) section for details on the required configuration parameters.

## Features

- Connects to Solace PubSub+ using the [Solace PubSub+ Python API](https://solace.dev).
- Pulls events from a durable exclusive queue.
- Supports incremental data syncing using timestamp-based filtering.
- Deduplicates messages using an internally generated `event_id`.
- Graceful error handling and logging.
- Tracks sync state for resumable operations.
- Optionally supports publishing test messages for development.

## Configuration file

The connector expects the following configuration in the `configuration.json` file:

```json
{
    "solace_host": "<YOUR_SOLACE_HOST>",
    "solace_username": "<YOUR_SOLACE_USERNAME>",
    "solace_password": "<YOUR_SOLACE_PASSWORD>",
    "solace_vpn": "<YOUR_SOLACE_VPN>",
    "solace_queue": "<YOUR_SOLACE_QUEUE>"
}
```

> Note: When submitting connector code as a [Community Connector](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran-csdk-connectors/tree/main) in the open-source [Connector SDK repository](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran-csdk-connectors/tree/main), ensure the `configuration.json` file has placeholder values. When adding the connector to your production repository, ensure that the `configuration.json` file is not checked into version control to protect sensitive information.

## Requirements file

Add the following to `requirements.txt`:

```
pandas==2.3.0
solace-pubsubplus==1.10.0
```

> Note: [Some packages](https://fivetran.com/docs/connector-sdk/technical-reference#preinstalledpackages) are pre-installed in the Connector SDK runtime environment. To avoid dependency conflicts, do not declare them in your `requirements.txt`.

## Authentication

The connector authenticates to Solace using basic credentials and VPN configuration:

- `solace_host`: Solace broker host
- `solace_username`: Username for broker authentication
- `solace_password`: Password for broker authentication
- `solace_vpn`: VPN name (default is `default`)

SSL validation is disabled in local development. Modify the `SolaceAuth` class to enable certificate validation if required.

## Pagination

The connector consumes messages in batches from a durable, exclusive queue until the configured batch size limit is reached.

Messages are retrieved using:
```python
message = receiver.receive_message(timeout=1000)
```

This allows the connector to stream messages efficiently with timeout-based pagination

## Data handling

The connector processes events from Solace as follows:

- Establishes a connection to the Solace broker using durable queue subscriptions.
- Receives messages one at a time using Solace's persistent message receiver.
- Parses each message payload (expects JSON structure).
- Extracts relevant metadata including timestamp, topic, and message ID.
- Skips and removes messages older than the last sync timestamp from queue.
- Constructs structured records and appends processing metadata.
- Deduplicates events using a combination of `event_id` and `timestamp`.
- Upserts cleaned records for inserting into the destination table.

Each event includes:

- `event_id`: A generated hash-based unique ID.
- `message_id`: Optional ID from the payload.
- `timestamp`: Event timestamp (from payload or receive time).
- `topic`: Source Solace topic or queue.
- `message_payload`: Raw message body.
- `message_type`: Type extracted from payload (default: `"raw"`).
- `details`: Optional field from payload.
- `processed_at`: Timestamp the message was processed.

## Error handling

This connector includes robust error handling at various stages:

- Connection errors: Fail fast with meaningful error messages if connection to the broker fails.
- Message processing errors: Malformed or unexpected payloads are logged and skipped without halting the sync.
- Upsert failures: Logged per record, allowing the connector to continue processing other events.
- Timeouts and retries: Configurable timeout ensures the sync completes even if the queue is empty or slow.

## Tables created

The connector creates a single table named `solace_events` (refer to the `schema()` function):

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `event_id` | STRING | Primary key – hash-based unique identifier derived from topic, timestamp, and payload |
| `timestamp` | STRING | Primary key – event timestamp |
| `message_id` | STRING | Optional message ID from the payload |
| `topic` | STRING | Source Solace topic or queue name |
| `message_payload` | STRING | Raw message body |
| `message_type` | STRING | Message type extracted from payload (default: `"raw"`) |
| `details` | STRING | Optional details field from payload |
| `processed_at` | STRING | Timestamp when the message was processed by the connector |
