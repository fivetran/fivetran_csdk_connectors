# Sensor Tower Connector Example

## Connector overview

This example demonstrates how to build a Fivetran Connector SDK integration for [Sensor Tower](https://sensortower.com), a market intelligence and analytics platform that provides insights into mobile apps, app store trends, and digital advertising. The connector pulls data from the Sensor Tower API for three tables: `SALES_REPORT_ESTIMATES`, `ACTIVE_USERS`, and `RETENTION`. You can configure the connector to track specific iOS and Android app IDs to gather the necessary information for your use case.

## Requirements

- [Supported Python versions](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran-csdk-connectors/blob/main/README.md#requirements)
- Operating system:
  - Windows 10 or later
  - macOS 13 (Ventura) or later
  - Linux: Distributions such as Ubuntu 20.04 or later, Debian 10 or later, or Amazon Linux 2 or later (arm64 or x86_64)

## Getting started

Refer to the [Connector SDK Setup Guide](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/setup-guide) to get started.

To initialize a new Connector SDK project using this connector as a starting point, run:

```
fivetran init --template sensor_tower
```

`fivetran init` initializes a new Connector SDK project by setting up the project structure, configuration files, and a connector you can run immediately with `fivetran debug`. For more information on `fivetran init`, refer to the [Connector SDK `init` documentation](https://fivetran.com/docs/connector-sdk/connector-development-and-configuration/connector-sdk-commands#fivetraninit).

> Note: Ensure you have updated the `configuration.json` file with the necessary parameters before running `fivetran debug`. See the [Configuration file](#configuration-file) section for details on the required configuration parameters.

## Features

- Supports three Sensor Tower endpoints: `SALES_REPORT_ESTIMATES`, `ACTIVE_USERS`, and `RETENTION` (see `ENDPOINTS` in `connector.py`)
- Handles both iOS and Android app IDs (see `IOS_APP_IDS` and `ANDROID_APP_IDS`)
- Incremental syncs with configurable lookback window (see `update` function)
- Schema mapping and column renaming for clarity (see `key_mapping` and `process_sales_report`)
- Modular data processing for each endpoint (see `process_active_users`, `process_sales_report`, and `process_retention`)

## Configuration file

The connector expects a `configuration.json` file with the following structure:

```json
{
  "auth_token": "YOUR_SENSOR_TOWER_API_TOKEN"
}
```

> Note: When submitting connector code as a [Community Connector](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran-csdk-connectors/tree/main) in the open-source [Connector SDK repository](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran-csdk-connectors/tree/main), ensure the `configuration.json` file has placeholder values. When adding the connector to your production repository, ensure that the `configuration.json` file is not checked into version control to protect sensitive information.

## Requirements file

The `requirements.txt` file specifies any additional Python libraries required by the connector. For this example, no extra dependencies are required beyond the Fivetran environment defaults.

Example content of `requirements.txt`:

```
python_dateutil==2.9.0.post0
pytz==2024.2
```

> Note: The `fivetran_connector_sdk:latest`, `requests:2.33.0`, `grpcio:1.78.0`, and `grpcio-tools:1.78.0` packages are pre-installed in the Fivetran environment. To avoid dependency conflicts, do not declare them in your `requirements.txt`.

## Authentication

The connector requires a Sensor Tower API token for authentication. Obtain an API token from your Sensor Tower account dashboard. You should provide the token in the `configuration.json` file as the value for the `auth_token` key. (See `update` function in `connector.py`)

## Pagination

This example does not implement explicit pagination because the Sensor Tower API endpoints the example connector communicates with either return all requested data in a single response or are filtered by date range and country. (See `get_data` function)

## Data handling

- Data is retrieved from the Sensor Tower API using the `get_data` function.
- Each endpoint is processed by a dedicated function:
  - `process_active_users` (see lines ~90-102)
  - `process_sales_report` (see lines ~104-115)
  - `process_retention` (see lines ~117-129)
- Data is mapped and transformed as needed (e.g., column renaming for `sales_report_estimates` via `key_mapping`).
- All records are delivered to Fivetran using the `op.upsert` operation.
- The schema is defined in the `schema` function (see lines ~44-66).

## Error handling

This example does not implement custom error handling. Any HTTP or API errors will raise exceptions via the `requests` library. (See `get_data` function)

## Tables created

- `sales_report_estimates` – Contains app sales and revenue estimates by date and country.
- `active_users` – Tracks active user counts by app, date, time period, and country.
- `retention` – Provides retention metrics by app, date, and country.

Sample data structure:

| App ID | Date       | Country code | iPhone downloads | iPhone revenue | ... |
|--------|------------|--------------|------------------|----------------|-----|
| 123456 | 2024-05-01 | US           | 1000             | 5000           | ... |

## Additional files

This example does not include additional files beyond the main connector script and configuration.
